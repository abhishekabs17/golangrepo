Escape Analysis in Go

Definition:
Escape analysis is a compiler optimization technique in Go that determines whether a variable can be safely allocated on the stack or must "escape" to the heap.

Stack allocation â†’ faster, automatically cleaned up when function returns.

Heap allocation â†’ slower (needs garbage collection), but survives beyond function scope.

ðŸ‘‰ Rule of thumb:

If a variableâ€™s lifetime ends within the function â†’ allocated on stack.

If a variable/reference is returned or used outside â†’ escapes to heap.


Memory Allocation (Stack vs Heap)

1.Stack â†’ used for local variables inside a function (fast allocation, automatically freed).

2.Heap â†’ used when variables escape function scope (e.g., returned, referenced elsewhere).

3.Escape analysis decides whether allocation happens on stack or heap.
